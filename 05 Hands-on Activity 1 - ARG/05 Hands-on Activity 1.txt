Procedure:
1. Create a folder named LastName_FirstName (ex. Reyes_Mark) in your local drive.
2. Create a new project named LabExer5A. Set the project location to your own folder.
3. The program shall:
generate a random number from 1 to 50 for a player to guess;
display a message that indicates whether the player's guess is correct, too low, or too high; and
prompt the user to keep on guessing until the correct value is entered
4. Create a try-catch structure that will handle two (2) exceptions. These are when the user inputs the following:
a number that is out of range (1-50)
a letter or any non-numeric character
5. Prompt the user so that he can guess again if an exception is thrown.
6. Display the number of total guesses.
Note: An invalid input (when an exception is thrown) is not considered a valid guess or attempt.
