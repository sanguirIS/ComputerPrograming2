1. Create four (4) Java classes. Name them RunEmployee, Employee, FullTimeEmployee, PartTimeEmployee. The Run Employee class shall contain the main method and will be used to execute the program.
2. Write a simple payroll program that will display employee's information. Refer to the UML Class Diagram for the names of the variable and method. This should be the sequence of the program upon execution:
a. Ask the user to input the name of the employee.
b. Prompt the user to select between full time and part time by pressing either F (full time) or P (part time).
C. If F is pressed, ask the user to type his monthly salary. Then, display his name and monthly
salary.
If P is pressed, ask the user to type his rate (pay) per hour and the number of hours he worked for the entire month separated by a space. Then, display his name and wage.
Employee
name: String
+ setName(): void
+ getName(): String
FullTimeEmployee
monthly Salary: double
+ setMonthlySalary(): void
+ getMonthlySalary(): double
PartTimeEmployee
ratePerHour: double
hoursWorked: int
wage: double
+ setWage(): void
+ getWage(): double
Note: You can add variables and methods if needed. Just make sure that all the variables and methods in the diagram are properly used.
