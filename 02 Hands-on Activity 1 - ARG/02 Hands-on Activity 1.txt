1. Create a folder named LastName_FirstName (ex. Reyes_Mark) in your local drive.
2. Create a project named LabExer2. Set the project location to your own folder.
3. Construct a simple purchasing program based on the UML Class Diagram below.
LabExer2
itemName: String
itemPrice: double
itemQuantity: int
amountDue: double
+ setItemName(String newItemName): void
+ setTotalCost (int quantity, double price): void
+ getItemName(): String
+ getTotalCost(): double
+ readInput(): void
+ writeOutput(): void
Note: The readInput() method will be used to accept user input through the Scanner class. This is
done by:
a. Writing import java.util.*; on top of the code, before the line for the class name
b. Instantiating an object of the Scanner class, Scanner s = new Scanner (System.in);
c. Storing the input to the variable name based on data type
For String: s.nextLine()
For int: s.nextInt()
For double: s.nextDouble()
The writeOutput() method will be used to display an output similar to the sample below. You are purchasing 3 bag(s) at 1,745.5 each.
4. Inform your instructor once you are done.
Sample output:
Enter the name of the item you are purchasing.
bag
Enter the quantity and price separated by a space.
3 1475.50
You are purchasing 3 bag(s) at 1475.5 each.
