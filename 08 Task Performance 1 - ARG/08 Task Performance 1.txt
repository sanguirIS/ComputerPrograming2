Create a Java program that determines if two (2) words rhyme. 

Write the import statements to be able to use Scanner, Pattern, and Matcher.
Enable user input.
Create three (3) String variables.
word1 shall store the first word.
word2 shall store the second word.
sub shall store the last two (2) letters of word1.
Initialize a Pattern as defined by the regular expression "[______]{___}" + sub + " " For the first blank, allow uppercase and lowercase letters. For the second blank, allow either 1 or 2 letters before sub (contains the last two (2) letters of word1).
Initialize a Matcher to store a possible match between your pattern and word2.
Use the matches() method to check if the two (2) words rhyme.
 

Sample Output:

Enter the first word: glam

Enter the second word: slam

slam rhymes with glam

//word2 has 2 letters before 'am' 

 

Enter the first word: glam

Enter the second word: ham

ham rhymes with glam

//word2 only has 1 letter before 'am' 

 

Enter the first word: beat

Enter the second word: treat

I'm not sure! Sorry!

//word2 has more than 2 letters before 'at'
